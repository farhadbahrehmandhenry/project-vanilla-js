- GRAPH:

  - nodes (vertex) and connections (edge)
  - social media - friends - map ...
  - adjacency matrix- 2d array like multiplication table
    - more space - slower, but faster search
  - adjacency list - less space, fatser, but slower in search

    - list of lists - index (vertex) inner array (connected vertex)
    - object of lists

  - types:

    - weighted/unweighted => edge has value
    - directed/udirected => edge has direction

  - all trees are graph
    - in graph there is not any heas or starting point
    - in tree there is only one way to get to a node, but in graph is different
